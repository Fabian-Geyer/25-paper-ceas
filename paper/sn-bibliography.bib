  abstract = {The Cape Peninsula University of Technology in collaboration with Stellenbosch University, is developing a 3-unit CubeSat for a low earth polar orbit. The two main payloads are a camera and a radio frequency beacon that will be used to calibrate the radar antenna patterns of the Hermanus Magnetic Observatory at their base in Antarctica. Stellenbosch University is responsible for the attitude determination and control system development. In this paper we present the design and development of a suitable aerodynamic attitude control system for this CubeSat, keeping in mind the restrictions in terms of mass, power and volume. The satellite is designed to use the aerodynamic disturbance torques on the satellite to our advantage by means of passive antenna feathers for pitch and yaw control and active paddles for roll control. Combining this control with magnetic damping the satellite can be three-axis stabilised. Two configurations of the roll control paddles were considered and compared in terms of the required actuator power and the resulting output angle errors. Simulation results show that the satellite can be three-axis stabilised by means of this aerodynamic control method, but not within the specifications needed for sufficient imaging. Reaction wheels were included in the control system which resulted in a pointing accuracy and stability that complied with the requirements of the imaging payload. Based on our simulations, we conclude that the combination of magnetic and aerodynamic control will be sufficient for initial stabilisation of the satellite. For the imaging process, the three-axis reaction wheels will additionally be required. Copyright ©2011 by the International Astronautical Federation. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The space weather research community relies heavily on thermospheric density data to understand long‐term thermospheric variability, construct assimilative, empirical, and semiempirical global atmospheric models and validate model performance. One of the challenges in resolving accurate thermospheric density data sets from satellite orbital drag measurements is modeling appropriate physical aerodynamic drag force coefficients. The drag coefficient may change throughout the thermosphere due to model dependencies on composition and altitude. As such, existing drag coefficient model errors and corresponding errors in orbit‐derived density data sets and models may be altitude and solar cycle dependent with greater errors at higher altitudes around 500 km near the oxygen‐to‐helium transition region. In this paper, inter‐satellite observed‐to‐modeled density comparisons at ∼500 km are evaluated to constrain drag coefficient modeling assumptions. Observed densities are derived from accelerometer data for the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites and Two‐Line Element data for a set of compact satellites, while the NRLMSISE‐00 atmospheric model is used to obtain modeled densities and composition information. Density consistency results indicate that drag coefficient models with incomplete energy and momentum accommodation produce the most consistent densities, while the standard diffuse modeling approach may not be appropriate at these altitudes. Models with momentum accommodation between 0.5 and 0.9 and energy accommodation between 0.83 and 0.96 may be most appropriate at upper thermospheric altitudes. Modeling drag coefficients with diffuse gas‐surface interactions for the GRACE satellites could lead to errors in derived density of ∼25\% and in‐track satellite orbit prediction uncertainty during solar maximum conditions on the order of kilometers.},

A satellite with four panels is studied and the simplified method for calculating aerodynamic torque of each panel is proposed based on rarefied gas dynamics. The approximate linear relationship between aerodynamic torque and panel rotation angle is obtained by integrating four panels. According to the desired control torque, an algorithm for calculation of expected panel rotation angle is proposed based on the linear equations. Then the actual aerodynamic torque is obtained in the accurate aerodynamic model, which provide aerodynamic control torque instead of the traditional actuator. The case of adjusting from an initial attitude angle to zero attitude angle is simulated, in which only the panels are used as the actuator. Considering the interference of environmental torque and measurement error, the satellite is controlled to the desired attitude, which shows that this method is feasible and has good anti-interference ability.},

The system response is interpreted in terms of performance criteria such as the maximum control surface excursions, the speed of response and the associated orbital energy loss due to drag.

  abstract = {ADBSat is a novel software that determines the aerodynamic properties of any body in free-molecular flow. Its main advantage is the fast approximation of the aerodynamics of spacecraft in the lower end of the low-Earth orbit altitude range. It is a novel implementation of a panel method, where the body is represented as a set of fundamental elements and the sum of their individual aerodynamic properties makes up the properties of the whole. ADBSat's approach treats the shape as a set of flat triangular plates. These are read from a CAD geometry file in the Wavefront format, which can be created with most common CAD programs. A choice of gas-surface interaction models is available to represent the physics of free-molecular flow under different conditions. Its modular design means that other models can be easily and quickly implemented. It also benefits from a new shading algorithm for fast determination of elemental flow exposure. An example case is presented to show the capability and functionality of the program. Program summary Program Title: ADBSat CPC Library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/622n2yjg4w.1 Licensing provisions: GPLv3 Programming language: MATLAB Developer's repository link: https://github.com/nhcrisp/ADBSat Nature of problem: Quickly and accurately determining the aerodynamics of satellites in free-molecular flow. Solution method: A new implementation of the panel method has been devised. The satellite shape is passed to the program as a CAD model, comprised of a set of flat triangular plates. ADBSat then calculates the aerodynamic characteristics of each element using an appropriate mathematical model, and sums the contributions for the overall properties of the body. A novel shading algorithm identifies and removes the panels which do not contribute to the calculations due to being protected from the flow by other body features. ADBSat also has the capability to account for different materials within the shape. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: MATLAB's Aero-space Toolbox is required for the determination of environmental parameters, unless otherwise provided by the user. As the program takes as an input a completed model of the spacecraft, the user is responsible for all mesh quality checks. The methods employed therein are only valid for strict free-molecular flow, which the user must ensure. The accuracy of the method decreases for surfaces with high concavity or multiple particle impingement.},

Our main method of validation is comparing test cases between ADBSat, the current de facto standard of direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC), and published literature. ADBSat exhibits a significantly shorter runtime than DSMC and performs well, except where deep concavities are present in the satellite models. The shading algorithm also experiences problems when a large proportion of the satellite surface area is oriented parallel to the flow, but this can be mitigated by examining the body at small angles to this configuration ({\textpm} 0.1{$^\circ$}). We recommend that an error interval on ADBSat outputs of up to 3\% is adopted. Therefore, ADBSat is a suitable tool for quickly determining the aerodynamic characteristics of a wide range of satellite geometries in different environmental conditions in VLEO. It can also be used in a complementary manner to identify cases that warrant further investigation using other numerical-based methods.},

  abstract = {Very low Earth orbits (VLEO), typically classified as orbits below approximately 450~km in altitude, have the potential to provide significant benefits to spacecraft over those that operate in higher altitude orbits. This paper provides a comprehensive review and analysis of these benefits to spacecraft operations in VLEO, with parametric investigation of those which apply specifically to Earth observation missions. The most significant benefit for optical imaging systems is that a reduction in orbital altitude improves spatial resolution for a similar payload specification. Alternatively mass and volume savings can be made whilst maintaining a given performance. Similarly, for radar and lidar systems, the signal-to-noise ratio can be improved. Additional benefits include improved geospatial position accuracy, improvements in communications link-budgets, and greater launch vehicle insertion capability. The collision risk with orbital debris and radiation environment can be shown to be improved in lower altitude orbits, whilst compliance with IADC guidelines for spacecraft post-mission lifetime and deorbit is also assisted. Finally, VLEO offers opportunities to exploit novel atmosphere-breathing electric propulsion systems and aerodynamic attitude and orbit control methods. However, key challenges associated with our understanding of the lower thermosphere, aerodynamic drag, the requirement to provide a meaningful orbital lifetime whilst minimising spacecraft mass and complexity, and atomic oxygen erosion still require further research. Given the scope for significant commercial, societal, and environmental impact which can be realised with higher performing Earth observation platforms, renewed research efforts to address the challenges associated with VLEO operations are required.},

Operations in VLEOs will give radical advantages in terms of orbit accessibility, payload performance, protection from radiations, and end-of-life disposal. ABEP combines an intake to collect the residual atmosphere in front of the spacecraft and an electric thruster to ionize and accelerate the atmospheric particles. Such residual gas can be exploited as a renewable resource not only to keep the spacecraft on a VLEO, but also to remove the main limiting factor of spacecraft lifetime, i.e., the amount of stored propellant. Several realizations of the ABEP concept have been proposed, but the few end-to-end experimental campaigns highlighted the need to improve the concept functional design and the representativeness of simulated atmospheric flows. The difficulty in recreating the VLEO environment in a laboratory limits the data available to validate scaling laws and modelling efforts. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the main research and development efforts on the ABEP technology.},

  abstract = {To extend the lifetime of commercial and scientific satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO) and below (100-250 km of altitude) recent years showed an increased activity in the field of air-breathing electric propulsion as well as beamed-energy propulsion systems. However, preliminary studies showed that the propellant flow necessary for electrostatic propulsion at these altitudes exceeds the mass intake possible within reasonable limits, and that electrode erosion due to oxygen flow might limit the lifetime of eventual thruster systems. The pulsed plasma thruster (PPT), however, can be successfully operated with smaller mass intake and at relatively low power. This makes it an interesting candidate for air-breathing application in LEO and its feasibility is investigated within this paper. An analysis of such an air-breathing PPT system shows that for altitudes between 150 and 250 km, drag compensation is at least partially feasible assuming a thrust-to-power ratio of 30 mN/kW and a specific impulse of 5000 s. Further, to avoid electrode erosion, inductively heated electrothermal plasma generator technology is discussed to derive a possible propulsion system that can handle gaseous propellant without unfavorable side effects. Current technology can be used to create an estimated 4.4 mN of thrust per 1 mg/s of mass flow rate, which is sufficient to compensate the drag for small satellites in altitudes between 150 and 250 km.},

  abstract = {SOAR (Satellite for Orbital Aerodynamics Research) is a CubeSat mission designed to investigate the interaction between different materials and the atmospheric flow regime in Very Low Earth Orbits (VLEO) and to demonstrate aerodynamic attitude and orbit control manoeuvres. Improving knowledge of the gas-surface interactions is important for the design of future satellites operating in lower altitude orbits and will enable the identification of materials which can minimise drag or improve aerodynamic control, a key aim of the Horizon 2020 DISCOVERER project. In order to achieve these objectives, SOAR features two payloads: i) a set of steerable fins which provide the ability to expose different materials or surface finishes to the oncoming flow with varying angle of incidence whilst also providing variable geometry to investigate aerostability and aerodynamic control; and ii) an Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer with Time-of-Flight capability which enables accurate measurement of the in-situ flow composition, density, and thermospheric wind velocity. Using precise orbit and attitude determination information and the measured atmospheric flow characteristics the drag and side-force experienced by the satellite in orbit can studied and estimates of the aerodynamic coefficients calculated. This paper first presents the scientific design and operational concept of the SOAR mission, focusing on the stability and control strategy which enables the spacecraft to maintain the flow-pointing attitude required by the payloads. The methodology for recovery of the (relative) aerodynamic coefficients from the measured orbit and in-situ atmospheric data is then presented. Finally, the uncertainty of the resolved aerodynamic coefficients is estimated statistically using simulations.},

Three-axis attitude control can be achieved by adjusting the orientation of aerodynamic surfaces, benefiting from both drag and lift forces. However, complete control over the orbital motion of a satellite is unattainable using aerodynamic forces alone, as positive thrust cannot be generated. Nonetheless, this limitation does not apply when focusing on the control of a satellite formation. By properly modulating the orientation of panels, positive and negative relative forces can be generated. This paper shows that even in a formation of simple microsatellites, it is possible to achieve formation and attitude simultaneous control by using no other actuators than the aerodynamics surfaces.},

  abstract = {Earth observation spacecraft use sun-synchronous orbits because they enable observations of ground targets with similar illumination conditions over different passes. To achieve these orbits, spacecraft shall be orbiting the Earth at a particular inclination, which is a function of the orbiting altitude. In the low-Earth-orbit range, spacecraft experience aerodynamic drag, which makes the spacecraft orbit decay while the orbit inclination remains unchanged, hence loosing the sun-synchronous aspect of the orbit if no corrective measures are taken. A novel method is proposed whereby the sun-synchronous inclination is maintained, using aerodynamic lift, while the spacecraft decays due to aerodynamic drag. To achieve it, a lift-to-drag ratio in the range of 1.0–1.6 is required. This lift-to-drag ratio is not feasible with currently characterized surface properties but it may be achievable in the future. To apply this method in the present, propulsion that partially compensates the drag would be required to lower the lift-to-drag ratio requirement to a feasible level. This method could lower the propulsion requirements on low-altitude sun-synchronous spacecraft by letting them decay, but at the same time maintaining the sun-synchronous aspect of their orbits.},

The Euler's eigenaxis rotation that provides the shortest angular path between two orientations is considered as an 'optimal' maneuver. The control algorithm basically consists of linear feedback of error quaternions and body rates, and includes decoupling control torque that counteracts the natural gyroscopic coupling torque. But, in some cases with small angular rates, the gyroscopic decoupling control is not necessary for eigenaxis rotations. It is shown that large-angle, rest-to-rest maneuver about the Euler's eigenaxis can be simply achieved by a proper selection of feedback gain matrices of the quaternion feedback regulator. Furthermore, previous results in quaternion feedback stability analysis based on the Lyapunov method are significantly extended. Robustness of the globally stable, quaternion feedback regulator to spacecraft inertia matrix uncertainty is also discussed.},

  abstract = {Simulation of a 3U-sized standard platform with four control panels attached to the rear part of the satellite at an altitude of 300 km was performed in Simulink to verify the feasibility of the aerodynamic control. The entire controller is composed of three loops: one outer loop and two inner loops. The outer loop is based on the robust and tested quaternion error feedback regulator to provide the target torque input for the two inner loops. The inner loops are responsible for actuating the control panels, using the squareroot-based PI controller and a dedicated designed Panel Selecting Method (PSM) to achieve high-precision attitude control. The inner loop torque generation controller will determine when to switch to either a PSM or square-root PI controller based on the attitude error measured in the quaternion form. During the initial phase of the maneuver, the PSM will be in charge of pointing the satellite close to the desired attitude before the square-root PI controller takes over the control authority to achieve a smooth, steadystate response. The proposed aerodynamic control method will be compared with other controllers often used on the CubeSat platform, including the magnetorquer, to analyze the benefits of using aerodynamic control in various scenarios. Advantages like natural stabilization of the satellite’s attitude in both pitch and yaw axes using almost zero electricity compared to magnetorquers will be discussed. However, the lifetime of a VLEO CubeSat is of concern at very low orbit where the atmosphere air density is relatively high, and the reduction of the lifetime on the given orbit from the increased drag of aerodynamic control surfaces will be addressed in the present work to discuss the impact of aerodynamic control on the operation of CubeSat at VLEO. With the results showing a reasonable detumbling time compared to the traditional magnetorquer at 300 km and a high degree of control accuracy with moderate variations of attitude near the level flight, the aerodynamic controller and the proposed algorithms are proven to be effective in the applications of near nadir pointing missions or missions requiring only the fast response of the rolling motion at VLEO environment. In the last section, some directions of future works will be shortly discussed, which include data-driven control for handling atmospheric conditions of other planets and the formation flight by using pure aerodynamic control.},

Flying a satellite in a very low Earth orbit with an altitude of less than 450 km, namely VLEO, is a technological challenge. It leads to several advantages, such as increasing the resolution of optical payloads or increase signal to noise ratio, among others. The atmospheric density in VLEO is much higher than in typical low earth orbit altitudes, but still free molecular flow. This has serious consequences for the maneuverability of a satellite because significant aerodynamic torques and forces are produced. In order to guarantee the controllability of the spacecraft they have to be analyzed in depth. Moreover, at VLEO the density of atomic oxygen increases, which enables the use of air-breathing electric propulsion (ABEP). Scientists are researching in this field to use ABEP as a drag compensation system, and consequently an attitude control based on aerodynamic control could make sense. This combination of technologies may represent an opportunity to open new markets. In this work, several satellite geometric configurations were considered to analyze aerodynamic control: 3-axis control with feather configuration and 2-axis control with shuttlecock configuration. The analysis was performed by simulating the attitude of the satellite as well as the disturbances affecting the spacecraft. The models implemented to simulate the disturbances were the following: Gravitational gradient torque disturbance, magnetic dipole torque disturbance (magnetic field model IGRF12), and aerodynamic torque disturbances (aerodynamic model DTM2013 and wind model HWM14). The maneuvers analyzed were the following: detumbling or attitude stabilization, pointing and demisability. Different VLEO parameters were analyzed for every geometric configuration and spacecraft maneuver. The results determined which of the analyzed geometric configurations suits better for every maneuver.},

Common models such as Sentman’s assume that gas particles are reflected diffusely from a surface, which leads to the incorporation of energy accommodation into the model. This technical note discusses the limitations of existing approaches for handling energy accommodation and provides a generalized treatment thereof that is valid for any molecular speed ratio. A new general expression for the temperature ratio of reflected to impinging particles is derived, which, when used in a GSI model, does not limit it to hyperthermal flows. Additionally, a simplified hyperthermal approximation is presented, proven to be an asymptote of the general expression, and shown to be an improvement upon existing approximations by comparison for a realistic VLEO scenario. The results contribute to a better understanding and modeling of energy accommodation within GSI, potentially benefiting scientific investigations and operational applications of satellite aerodynamics.},

Especially noteworthy is the solar activity dependence of the Jacchia data, with which we study a large O+ contribution to the total mass density under the combination of summer, low solar activity, high latitude, and high altitude. Under these conditions, except at very low solar activity, the Jacchia data and the Jacchia-70 model indeed show a significantly higher total mass density than does MSISE-90. However, under the corresponding winter conditions, the MSIS-class models represent a noticeable improvement relative to Jacchia-70 over a wide range of F10.7.

The operational model is driven by the trusted and established F10.7 and \emph{Kp{$<$}i/{$>$} indices for solar and geomagnetic activity. The so-called research model is more accurate, but it uses the indices F30 and the hourly Hpo, which are not yet accredited operationally. \emph{Methods{$<$}i/{$>$}: The DTM2020 models’ backbone comprises GOCE, CHAMP, and Swarm A densities, processed by TU Delft, and Stella processed in-house. They constitute the standards for absolute densities, and they are 20–30\% smaller than the datasets used in the fit of DTM2013. Also, the global daily mean TLE densities at 250 km, spanning four solar cycles, were now used to improve solar cycle variations. The operational model employs the same algorithm as DTM2013, which was obtained through fitting all data in our database from 1967 to 2019. Because of the Hpo index, which is not available before 1995, the coefficients linked to the geomagnetic activity of the research model are fitted to data from 2000 to 2019. The algorithm was updated to take advantage of the higher cadence of Hpo. Both models are assessed with independent data and compared with the COSPAR International Reference Atmosphere models NRLMSISE-00, JB2008, and DTM2013. The bias and precision of the models are assessed through comparison with observations according to published metrics on several time scales. Secondly, binning of the density ratios are used to detect specific model errors. \emph{Results{$<$}i/{$>$}: The DTM2020 densities are on average 20–30\% smaller than those of DTM2013, NRLMSISE-00, and JB2008. The assessment shows that the research DTM2020 is the least biased and most precise model compared to assimilated data. It is a significant improvement over DTM2013 under all conditions and at all altitudes. This is confirmed by the comparison with independent SET HASDM density data. The operational DTM2020 is always less accurate than the research model except at 800 km altitude. It has comparable or slightly higher precision than DTM2013, despite using F10.7 instead of F30 as solar activity driver. DTM, and semi-empirical models in general, can still be significantly improved on the condition of setting up a more complete and consistent total density, composition, and temperature database than available at this time by means of a well-conceived observing system.}}}}},

Although attitude control systems using disturbance torques has been studied with various methods, most previous research has focused on attitude control using aerodynamic stability to remove disturbances. We propose a new attitude control system that actively uses disturbance torque. This system controls the attitude using disturbance torques by changing the equilibrium point of the attitude motion by changing the shape of the satellite. We formulate the attitude dynamics of a variable-shape satellite as a preliminary study. This paper shows that the satellite attitude can be adjusted by varying the equilibrium point of attitude motion by changing the satellite shape. Also, we investigate the stability around the equilibrium point for each shape, and the results show the distribution of the stability index and the equilibrium point for each shape. Finally, we show that the attitude asymptotically converges to an equilibrium point by using the variable shape function and magnetic control.},

  abstract = {The Satellite for Orbital Aerodynamics Research (SOAR) is a 3U CubeSat mission that aims to investigate the gas--surface interactions (GSIs) of different materials in the very low Earth orbit environment (VLEO), i.e. below 450 km. Improving the understanding of these interactions is critical for the development of satellites that can operate sustainably at these lower orbital altitudes, with particular application to future Earth observation and communications missions. SOAR has been designed to perform the characterisation of the aerodynamic coefficients of four different materials at different angles of incidence with respect to the flow and at different altitudes in the VLEO altitude range. Two conventional and erosion-resistant materials (borosilicate glass and sputter-coated gold) have first been selected to support the validation of the ground-based Rarefied Orbital Aerodynamics Research (ROAR) facility. Two further, novel materials have been selected for their potential to reduce the drag experienced in orbit whilst also remaining resistant to the detrimental effects of atomic oxygen erosion in VLEO. In this paper, the uncertainty associated with the experimental method for determining the aerodynamic coefficients of satellite with different configurations of the test materials from on-orbit data is estimated for different assumed gas--surface interaction properties. The presented results indicate that for reducing surface accommodation coefficients the experimental uncertainty on the drag coefficient determination generally increases, a result of increased aerodynamic attitude perturbations. This effect is also exacerbated by the high atmospheric density at low orbital altitude (i.e. 200 km), resulting in high experimental uncertainty. Co-rotated steerable fin configurations are shown to provide generally lower experimental uncertainty than counter-rotated configurations, with the lowest uncertainties expected in the mid-VLEO altitudes (\$\${\textbackslash}sim\$\$300 km). For drag coefficient experiments, configurations with two fins oriented at 90\$\${\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ \}\$\$were found to allow the best differentiation between surfaces with different GSI performance. In comparison, the determination of the lift coefficient is found to be improve as the altitude is reduced from 400 to 200 km. These experiments were also found to show the best expected performance in determining the GSI properties of different materials. SOAR was deployed into an orbit of 421 km~\$\${\textbackslash}times\$\$~415 km with 51.6\$\${\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ \}\$\$inclination on 14 June 2021. This orbit will naturally decay allowing access to different altitudes over the lifetime of the mission. The results presented in this paper will be used to plan the experimental schedule for this mission and to maximise the scientific output.},

  abstract = {In December 2019, the International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy (IAGA) Division V Working Group (V-MOD) adopted the thirteenth generation of the International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF). This IGRF updates the previous generation with a definitive main field model for epoch 2015.0, a main field model for epoch 2020.0, and a predictive linear secular variation for 2020.0 to 2025.0. This letter provides the equations defining the IGRF, the spherical harmonic coefficients for this thirteenth generation model, maps of magnetic declination, inclination and total field intensity for the epoch 2020.0, and maps of their predicted rate of change for the 2020.0 to 2025.0 time period.},
